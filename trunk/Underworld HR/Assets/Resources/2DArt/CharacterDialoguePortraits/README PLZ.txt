HI!
Here are some guidelines to follow before adding images to folders!

1.If you aren't sure where an image goes, be sure to ask someone before adding it!

2. Technical requirements for the images!:
	a. The images must be in PNG format.
	b. The images must have completely transparent backgrounds.
	c. The images (more specifically, the files) must ALL be of the same dimensions. 
		______ px X ______ px (___ px X 810px?: Need to confirm with Reymar)
		Theymust be this size REGARDLESS OF the Character's height, size, body build etc.
		For example, if Agnes is shorter than Anubis, she will still be in an image of the same dimensions. 
		It is her placement/scale that will show her difference in size.
	d. When cropping the images, ensure all characters have their feet (or the lowest part of their body for souls/sleeping/sitting characters) the same distance from the bottom border of the image.
		For example, if you were to place all of the images of humanoid characters side by side, their feet would all be level with each other, but their heads might not.
		The souls are unique because they are small and float. Try to place them in the upper-two-thirds of the frame so that they will not be blocked by the text boxes.

3. Gods, Agnes and the coworker have a dedicated folder because they appear in multiple scenes.

4. Please do your best to match the name of the file with the name of the character model they are representing. 
	As of now, the file names are very hard to read and confusing, and need to be opened to get a notion of where they belong, making it very difficult to assign them in-game.
